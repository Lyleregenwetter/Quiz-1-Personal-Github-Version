General info,Notes,,Its a 29" hardtail with some angles in the frame resembling some popular full suspension bikes. I tried to add Trek's (Gary Fisher) G2 Geometry to the 100mm fork with 'eye-ball' accuracy. Some of the smaller compnents were changed also, but stock and standard sizes will most likely be better than mine (ie. the size of the stanchins and size and length of the fork lowers).,,Driving
General info,Title block notes,,Hardy Marty 29er. Green/Black, 30spd (XTR configuration), frame designs inspiration from Yeti, Specialized, Trek(Fisher), and personal.
