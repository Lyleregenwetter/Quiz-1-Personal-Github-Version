General info,Notes,,This model is from published measurements and some rough/visual estimates: the seat tube extensions is a guess, and I couldn't find wheelbase measurements.  As a result, there is ambiguity in the seattube/headtube relationship.  If you really want to make this precise, we need the seattube extension and toptube angle.,,Driving
