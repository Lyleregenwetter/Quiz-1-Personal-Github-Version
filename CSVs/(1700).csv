General info,Notes,,This is a derived design. The final thing is my own but it was derived off a design by one of the users of this site. The Scorpion is the original bike. Well anyway, the stats for this bike are: 26 inch wheels, RockShox BoXXer World Cup fork, Avid Code R hydraulic disk brakes (203 mm rotors front and rear), 1 x 9 speed drivetrain. The bike is equipped with a Cane Creek Double Barrel air shock on the rear Horst Link suspension system.,,Driving
